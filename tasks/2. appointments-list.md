# Appointments list

## Selectors

Create a logic for calculation of derived data. Add these functions in `./store/selectors.ts`. All selectors should accept appointments as a first argument.

Implement these selectors:

1. Selector that calculates total amount of appointments
2. Selector that filters appointments for specific date
3. Selector that filters appointments for specific doctors (should be a list of names)

## UI

On the appointment list page add datepicker and multiselect that allow to select filters and apply logic
