# Bootstrap project

## Basic setup

1. Install main dependencies for `redux`, `@redux/toolkit`, `react-router`, `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`.
2. Create folder `mocks` and add file `doctors.ts` with this content:

```ts
const doctors = [
  { name: "Dr. Smith", specialty: "Cardiology" },
  { name: "Dr. Johnson", specialty: "Dermatology" },
  { name: "Dr. Lee", specialty: "Pediatrics" },
  { name: "Dr. Brown", specialty: "Neurology" },
  { name: "Dr. Davis", specialty: "Orthopedics" },
];
```

## Routing

1. Setup router in [`App`](../src/App.tsx)
2. Add `Layout` that will contain header with 2 `NavLink`s - `Appointments` and `Add appointment`.

## Add appointment page

1. Create a form that will consist of 2 fields - `Appointment date` (should use MUI datepicker) and `Doctor` (should use MUI `Select` with doctors.ts as options)
2. Setup redux store.
3. Create a slice for appointments. Add logic that will add and remove appointment
